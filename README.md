Analysis pipeline for RNAseq data 
Study the difference in gene expression level between sample groups 
Pipeline includes quality assessment of the raw sequencing data, alignment of read pairs to the genome, generation of gene count data, analysis of statistical mean of the count per gene, & fold change of the average gene expression level compared between groups
